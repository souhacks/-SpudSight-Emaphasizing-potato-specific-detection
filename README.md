## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient detection model for potato plants and leaves using the YOLOv5 object detection framework and deploy it for real-time use.

---

## Features

- **Efficient Data Collection**: Automated image scraping using BingDownloader.
- **Accurate Data Annotation**: Generated bounding box annotations with labelImg.
- **State-of-the-Art Detection**: Trained using YOLOv5 for high-accuracy detection.
- **Real-time Performance**: Integrated detection pipeline with OpenCV.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin for edge computing.

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Downloaded thousands of potato leaf/plant images using the BingDownloader library.
- Organized the dataset into `train/` and `test/` folders for training and testing.

### 2. Data Annotation
- Annotated the dataset using **labelImg**, saving bounding box data in `.xml` format.
- Converted the annotations to YOLO format (center x, center y, width, height).

### 3. Model Training
- Trained the YOLOv5 model using annotated data.
- Tested and evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and mAP metrics.
- Generated prediction files for further analysis and refinement.

### 4. Real-time Detection
- Built a real-time detection application using **OpenCV** to process live video feeds or image inputs.
- Visualized bounding boxes and detection scores during inference.

### 5. Deployment
- Deployed the project on **NVIDIA Jetson Orin**, leveraging its GPU for faster inference.
- Uploaded the complete project with documentation and code to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/potato-yolo-detection.git
   cd potato-yolo-detection
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv yolov5-env
   source yolov5-env/bin/activate  # For Windows: yolov5-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Organize the Dataset**:
   - Place images in the `data/train/` and `data/test/` folders.
   - Ensure YOLO annotations are correctly formatted.

5. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
   ```

6. **Run Real-time Detection**:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --source 0  # Use webcam as the input source
   ```

7. **Deploy on NVIDIA Jetson Orin**:
   - Transfer the trained weights and scripts to the Jetson device.
   - Install dependencies and run the detection script.
